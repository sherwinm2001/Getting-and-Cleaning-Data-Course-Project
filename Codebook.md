## Features
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. 

Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

	tBodyAcc-XYZ
	tGravityAcc-XYZ
	tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
	tBodyGyro-XYZ
	tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
	tBodyAccMag
	tGravityAccMag
	tBodyAccJerkMag
	tBodyGyroMag
	tBodyGyroJerkMag
	fBodyAcc-XYZ
	fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
	fBodyGyro-XYZ
	fBodyAccMag
	fBodyAccJerkMag
	fBodyGyroMag
	fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

	mean(): Mean value
	std(): Standard deviation
	mad(): Median absolute deviation 
	max(): Largest value in array
	min(): Smallest value in array
	sma(): Signal magnitude area
	energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
	iqr(): Interquartile range 
	entropy(): Signal entropy
	arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
	correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
	maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
	meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
	skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
	kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
	bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
	angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

	gravityMean
	tBodyAccMean
	tBodyAccJerkMean
	tBodyGyroMean
	tBodyGyroJerkMean


## run_analysis.R - Steps in detail
1. Install dplyr package first and load the dplyr library.
2. Download data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.
3. Unzip the downloaded zip file.
4. Assign data to tables.
5. Assign descriptive coloumn names to tables
6. Merge train and test data
7. Extract mean and standard deviation values for each measurement (i.e. SubjectID and its corresponding ActivityID)
8. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
9. Writing and saving the created tidy data set in the .txt format.
